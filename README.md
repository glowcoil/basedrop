# üêü‚§µÔ∏è basedrop

A set of memory-management tools for real-time audio and other latency-critical scenarios.

`basedrop` provides smart pointers analogous to `Box` and `Arc` which mark their contents for deferred collection on another thread rather than immediately freeing it, making them safe to drop on a real-time thread.
